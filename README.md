# RNN_Music_Generator_Project
A ML model for generating music, based on RNN.It uses a character-level LSTM to generate Irish folk music using ABC notation.

## Features
- TensorFlow RNN using LSTM
- ABC music dataset
- Music generation and playback
- Comet ML for training tracking

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
2. Run the notebook
3. Listen to generated `.wav` songs

4. ## Credits
Dataset and template from [MIT Deep Learning](http://introtodeeplearning.com/)
